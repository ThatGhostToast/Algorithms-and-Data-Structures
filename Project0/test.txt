somebody
once
told
me
the
world
was
gonna
roll
me
i
aint
the
sharpest
tool
in
the
shed
she
was
looking
kinda
dumb
with
her
finger
and
her
thumb
in
the
shape
of
an
l
on
her
forehead
well
the
years
start
coming
they
dont
stop
coming
fed
to
the
rules
and
I
hit
the
ground
running
didnt
make
sense
not
to
live
for
fun
the
brain
gets
smart
but 
the
head
gets
dumb
so
much
to
do
so
much
to
see
so
whats
wrong
with
taking
the
back
streets
youll
never
know
if
you
dont
go
